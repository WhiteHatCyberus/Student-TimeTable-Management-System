# Student-TimeTable-Management-System
A timetable management system with 5 tables [ 3 subjects , 2 classes] using Java as Frontend and MySQL scheme and database tables as backend.

# For anyone reviewing this project!
> **Note** This was part of a minor project back in university, I would highly recommend you use this code under your own discretion.

# Usage
The java code features a menu driven program that manipulates the data on static tables hosted on mysql.
**You will have to manually create the table, as seen in output.docx**
> Again, read the code carefully and make changes accordingly.
